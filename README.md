# termite-install

A termite installation script for Ubuntu users (and other Ubuntu-based distributions)

# DISCLAIMER

This is not going to be maintained, it was supposed to be a temporary solution back in 2015.
The real solution to this problem is a maintained package, not a 15 lines script.
Anyway, if it can help someone to install his favorite terminal emulator, go ahead, use the script, modify it, do what you want with it.
But as I do not use an Ubuntu or Debian based distribution anymore, I do not think I am the right person to handle the packaging.
